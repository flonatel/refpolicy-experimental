Experimental branch of Debian's refpolicy.

Because when trying to fix issus in the refpolicy, I run into the
problem that old problems come up again and again.  Also some fixes
depend on other fixes.
Therefore I created this experimental repository: to track all the
changes and give the maintainers a (hopefully) easy way to pull
changes.
